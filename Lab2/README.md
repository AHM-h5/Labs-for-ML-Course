## Description
The dataset used in this lab is the House Price Prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle. It contains information about residential houses, including features such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, number of floors, year built, location, house condition, and availability of a garage.

The dataset is structured in a tabular format and is suitable for machine learning tasks. Each row represents a single house, while each column represents a specific feature describing the house.

## Machine Learning Problem
The objective of this project is to predict the price of a house based on its features.

This is a regression problem because the target variable is a continuous numerical value.

## Target Variable
The target variable in this dataset is the house price.
